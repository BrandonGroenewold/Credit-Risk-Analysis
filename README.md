# Predicting Credit Risk

Skills used:
- Machine Learning, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, Confusion Matrix

 A machine learning model was buildt to predict whether a loan will be approved or not for a customer based on loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts they have, derogatory marks, and total debt. 

## Instructions to recreate

### Retrieve the data

The data is located in the Resources folder.

* `lending_data.csv`

Import the data using Pandas.

## Create the models

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

### Logistic Regression Model
- Start by defining your X and y
- Split the data into training and testing data
- Create a logistic regression model
- Fit or "train" your model with the training data
- Validate the model by using the test data (print out your scores)
- Add a confusion matrix if you desire

### Random Forest Classifier
- Create the data
- Form your RandomForestClassifier
- Print your training and test scores
- You can then create a bar chart to display feature importances

## Analysis
- You can then read the analysis in the analysis text file or at the bottom of the notebook.
- Feel free to write your own or make comparisons on what you thought.
